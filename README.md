# Weather App

In this project, which I did as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript curriculum, I practiced working with API's and asynchronous JavaScript.

## Reflection

- This was a fun and relatively quick project. It was also an opportunity to again practice working with webpack and splitting my code into modules.
- I'm quite content with the CSS. Especially for very small devices I puzzled quite a while about what to do with the footer. I think the responsive design is generally working fine here, but has still some room for improvement.
- This project would have benefitted from better planning. Maybe it's time to look into design patterns.
- My DOM-manipulation functions are quite long. Next time I should try to make them shorter and use more helpers or maybe try an object-oriented approach.
